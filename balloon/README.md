# Balloon

from (Eloquent JS) [https://eloquentjavascript.net/15_event.html]

The page displays a balloon (ðŸŽˆ). When you press the up arrow, it inflates (grow) 10 percent, and when you press the down arrow, itvdeflates (shrink) 10 percent.

The balloon will explode past a certain size. Exploding means that it is replaced with an ðŸ’¥ emoji, and the event handler is removed (so that you canâ€™t inflate or deflate the explosion).
